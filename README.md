# New York City Airbnb data:
## Step 1

This is a dataset that contains Airbnb data on New York City. You will use it to practice your new EDA (exploratory data analysis) and data cleaning skills.

Use the following online dataset:

## Step 2:

Use the explore.ipynb notebook to find patterns and valuable information as much as you can. Make graphs that helps us understand the patterns found, get some statistics, create new variables if needed, etc.

What can we learn about different hosts and areas?
Which hosts are the busiest and why?
Is there any noticeable difference of traffic among different areas and what could be the reason for it?
Don't forget to write your observations.

## Step 3:

Now that you have a beautiful EDA notebook, and you have a better knowledge of the data, let's imagine Airbnb asks you to deliver a machine learning pipeline that cleans the data, in order to give it to their modeling area for future price prediction.

Use the app.py to create your cleaning pipeline that makes data ready for modeling. Save your clean data in the 'Processed' data folder.

We used to add our .env file into the .gitignore file in order to hide our passwords and credentials from version control.
